        <p>The Alabama Political Reporter Site demonstrates a clean layout supported by plenty of
            white space in the design.  By keeping this white space around the information on the page
            it allows the numbers to speak for themselves.  In a landscape where COVID data 
            is often mired in cluttered dashboards with lots of difficult to parse information 
            this site is a breath of fresh air.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>

        <br>
        <img src="images/target.jpg" alt="screenshot of Target.com website">
        <p>Throughout Target's website they make great use of alignment.  Choosing to have these items
            grouped together with such clear order amongst them allows our brains to categorize these items
            and more easily parse that they have a similar meaning on the website.  In the case of this 
            particular screenshot, we can see that these repeated and aligned elements are all categories
            at a similar level of hierarchy in the site navigation.

        <img src="images/warbyparker.jpg" alt="screenshot of Warby Parker website">
        <p>Through use of proximity, Warby Parker communicates that various elements on their site are 
            related to each other.  At the top of the site we see three words spaced near each other on one line.
            These three words clearly reperesent three categories we can choose from to further navigate the site.
            In the same manner, we have two filters presented below the image.  These two words are placed right near
            each other as well, also showing a close relationship.  By presenting the information neatly grouped into
            proximal locations, it makes it easier for us to navigate the site and understand the information is related
            to each other.
